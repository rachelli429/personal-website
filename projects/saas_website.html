              As one of the Web Development directors for SAAS in Fall 2019 and
              Spring 2020, I co-led the Web Development committee through
              multiple redesigns of the website.

                The old SAAS website had a darker color scheme with a black navbar. One of my primary issues with the old website design was the use of the color tan. It made the website look old/archaic, like tan-colored historical documents. The background in some parts of the website was tan-colored, and the boxes on the committee pages (Research and Publication is shown in the video) were also tan. There were few visuals on the website, making the website overall less engaging and difficult to read, with large chunks of text. The blog pages felt rather empty as the text only took up a little over half of the page. On the People page, it was unclear what the speech bubble did — when you clicked it, a description of the selected person would pop up in a row underneath the photos. However, this description would be center aligned in the row such that it was difficult to tell whose photo the description was referring to.

            <p>The current SAAS website can be found <a href="https://saas.berkeley.edu">here</a>!</p> Our overall goal was to make the website look more modern and welcoming, with a lighter (white) color scheme, the use of more fun design elements such as gradients and waves, and (slightly) rounded corners for boxes and images. We added information related to our brand identity and recruitment in order to provide more information to interested students. We added images to all of the committee pages and project boxes. For the project pages, we added fixed boxes in the right column to give basic information on the project (semester, project members) as well as a navigation menu. For the People page, we changed the descriptions to show up when you hover over photos.
