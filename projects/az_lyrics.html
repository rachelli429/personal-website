            I completed this project as my mid-semester group project for the
            Web Design DeCal, which I took in Fall 2018. We were tasked with
            redesigning the index, lyrics, search, and artist pages of the
            <a href="https://www.azlyrics.com/">AZLyrics website</a>. I created
            the mockup for our group using Adobe XD, and coded the header, index
            page, and lyrics page.
          </div>

        <div class="main-section">
          <p class="main-heading">Design Justification</p>
          <div class="main-content">
            Our overall goal was to create a more modern design that was easy to
            interact with. We introduced an “accounts” function where the user
            can create an account to save liked songs and create playlists. We
            chose to use pink and purple for the color scheme, as pink connotes
            compassion and purple connotes playfulness, which we thought were
            fitting for an entertainment website.

          <div class="main-content">
            <p>
              We had a large background image on the landing screen that
              embodies what AZ Lyrics is all about — listening to,
              understanding, and emphasizing with music. We felt that one of the
              key features of AZ Lyrics was the ability to conduct searches, so
              we emphasized the search box and added filters to allow users to
              clearly define what they are looking for.

            />
            <p>
              For the “What’s Hot?” section, only the album covers are initially
              displayed; the album title and artist name are shown on hover. We
              wanted to place more emphasis on visuals and declutter the page.

          <p class="main-heading">Lyrics Page</p>
          <div class="main-content">
            <p>
              For the lyrics page, we made use of a 2-column layout to
              simultaneously display important information for the user. When
              the user scrolls down to see more lyrics, the song/album/artist
              information does not go away. We grouped all action buttons
              together in a visible location.
