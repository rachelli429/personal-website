          <p class="main-heading">Overview</p>
          <div class="main-content">
            <p>
              As the new Internal Vice President of the Student Association for
              Applied Statistics (SAAS), I had creative control over all things
              related to design. I decided to lead a rebranding initiative for
              the following reasons:
            </p>
            <p class="main-subheading">
              1. Our old assets and designs were inconsistent
            </p>
            <p>
              When myself and other SAAS members created designs over the past
              year, we realized that there was little guidance on what colors
              and fonts to use. We chose whichever colors and fonts best fit our
              specific purpose, as long as the colors were blue and pink. This
              resulted in inconsistency across designs, so we wanted to
              standardize our branding visuals to better help designers.
            </p>
            <p class="main-subheading">2. The focus of the club has shifted</p>
            <p>
              Up until fall 2019, we were affiliated with the Statistics
              Department at UC Berkeley. In the summer of 2019, we split from
              the Statistics Department due to differences in vision for the
              organization. As a department-affiliated organization, we
              previously had to ensure that we retained a focus on statistics.
              Since our split, the club has shifted to focus more on
              applications of statistics and expand our projects to include
              fields such as econometrics, natural language processing, and
              business analytics.
            </p>
            <p class="main-subheading">3. Emergence of new clubs</p>
            <p>
              Over the past few years, more data science and tech clubs have
              emerged on campus. We wanted to create a clear, unique brand in
              order to better distinguish ourselves from these clubs and convey
              our value and culture to potential members and clients.

          <p class="main-heading">Brand Identity</p>
          <div class="main-content">
            <p>
              Before delving into the designs, myself and the rest of the
              executive team spent some time fleshing out our brand identity.
            </p>
            <p class="main-subheading">Mission</p>
            <p>
              We strive to foster an inclusive community for students at UC
              Berkeley with an interest in applied statistics.

          <div class="main-content">
            <p>
              Overall, we liked our old logo but felt that it would benefit from
              a few small fixes.
            </p>
            <!--TODO: edit image in illustrator to add white space on both sides-->
            <img src="../assets/images/work/saas_rebrand/old_logo.png" />
            <p>
              We wanted to keep the normal distribution because it is
              recognizable and a symbol that people clearly associate with
              statistics.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our new logo features a gradient from pink to blue that is purple
              in the middle, bolder text, and a slight change in the shape of
              the normal distribution so that the bars in the middle are taller.
              We also created versions of the logo that had our clubâ€™s full
              name.

          <div class="main-content">
            <p>
              We decided to keep pink and blue as our primary colors. Pink
              connotes feminity, gentleness, and compassion, which enhances our
              message of inclusivity. Blue connotes peace and trust, which
              emphasizes our goal of helping members build confidence.
            </p>
            <p>
              We turned the saturation down on the old pink and blue, deciding
              on <span id="saas-pink">#FFCOCB</span> for the pink and
              <span id="saas-blue">#87CEEB</span> for the blue.
            </p>
            <p>
              We chose purple <span id="saas-purple">#C0C2E2</span> as our
              secondary color, since it would be used often in gradients.

                We offer a wide spectrum of opportunities for our members across
                9 different committees. Our members come from different
                backgrounds and are interested in different areas within
                statistics. Gradients help to capture all of this diversity.

                Our use of waves represents how we connect club members within
                SAAS to each other as well as to faculty, companies, and other
                campus organizations.
